**NOTE**: I think a website like this can be useful and valuable to the Neovim community, but I don't plan on improving and maintaining the website unless people are using it. Please send me an email at [dan@axelby.com](mailto:dan@axelby.com) with any questions, comments, suggestions, etc.

# Neovim init.lua Configurator
This is a website that allows you to choose a package manager, plugins, and settings and will create an init.lua file for Neovim.

The configuration is bookmarkable and shareable. 

## Tech Notes
The website is build with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com). Vite runs and builds the site and Solid is a reactive framework similar to React except faster.

## TODO
- make attractive
- add package managers, plugins, and options
- put on real domain
- brainstorm a catchy name
- make the hashtag smaller
- [option a] add anonymous tracking, sell ads, then sell the website for millions
- [option b] bask in the adoration of the neovim community
